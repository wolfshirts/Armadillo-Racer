# Armadillo-Racer
This is a challenge from Headfirst C# 3rd edition. The goal was to create an application based on the
given design document. These armadillos race each other, 3 players can make bets. The whole things is done in
Winforms. Initially I was going to use space ships, but finding an asset to use was taking a lot of time away from
coding.
